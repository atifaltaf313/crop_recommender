## Crop Recommender
This is a web application that helps farmers select the most suitable crop to plant based on the characteristics of their soil and the weather conditions of their region. It uses machine learning to make predictions based on historical data and provides recommendations to users on which crops are likely to yield the best results.

## How it works
The app takes as input the soil type and weather conditions of the user's region, and uses a Naive Bayes classification model to predict which crops are most suitable for cultivation in that area. The model was trained on a dataset containing information on various crops and their corresponding characteristics, such as required pH level, temperature, rainfall, and humidity.

## Getting started
To run the app on your local machine, you'll need to install Streamlit and scikit-learn libraries using pip. You can do this by running the following commands in your terminal:


## Installation
To use this project, you will need to have Python 3.x installed on your system along with the following libraries:

pandas
numpy
scikit-learn
You can install these libraries using pip with the following command:

Copy code
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn
Once you have installed the required libraries, you can clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/atifaltaf313/crop-recommender.git
## Usage
To use the crop recommender system, you need to run the myapp.py file in your terminal or command prompt using the following command:

arduino
Copy code
streamlit run myapp.py
This will open the web application in your default browser, where you can enter the required soil and weather parameters to get the recommended crop.

Copy code
pip install streamlit
pip install scikit-learn
Next, clone this repository to your local machine and navigate to the project directory. Finally, run the following command in your terminal:

arduino
Copy code
streamlit run myapp.py
This will start the app on your local machine, and you can access it by navigating to the URL displayed in your terminal.

## Usage
Once the app is running, you can enter the details of such as soil type and weather conditions, in the input fields provided. Click on the "Predict" button to get a list of recommended crops based on your input.
